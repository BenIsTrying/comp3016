## How does it play?

This game is a basic maze/circuit puzzel game, the user must move across the board by manipulating their player icon **@** usign the **W** **A** **S** **D** keys.
The user starts on the **I** tile (input) and must connect this starting postion to the the **O** (output) by changing the enpty sqaurs to cables **C**.
Once the user has finished connecting these two points they must stand on the **O** for the board to be scanned and checked to see if they have won.
The users task is to get from **I** to **O** with the least amount of **C** cables used.
